## Dockerized React Example App

This app is a starter development environment for React Redux.

The demo app is based on the following courses: 

https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-bookshop-with-react-redux-i-react-redux-flow
https://scotch.io/tutorials/bookshop-with-react-redux-ii-async-requests-with-thunks


For deploying to the docker container just type:

docker-compose up -d


I'd like to add test running automation, so stay tuned!
